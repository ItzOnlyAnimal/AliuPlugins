        # 1.1.0
        - Added TimeZoneDB support (by mantikafasi)
        
        # 1.0.7
        - Made settings page look slightly nicer
        
        # Pretty important announcement
        I don't plan on adding any new features from now on, since I'm going to have work in irl/non-plugin areas.
        But I will be accepting PRs if you really want something in this plugin (or want to take it from me entirely!) :P
